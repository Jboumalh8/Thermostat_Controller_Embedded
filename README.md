# Thermostat_Controller_Embedded

C programming code for Thermostat Controller Embedded System


# Details:

•	The DS1631 should sense air temperate and the PIC24 should determine if heating or cooling
is needed to keep the air temperature within a user settable range

•	The LCD should provide the system state information, e.g. the current temperature in large characters and some indication if heating, cooling or off

•	The pushbuttons and LCD panel should be used to allow a user to input high and low temperature set points

•	The serial port should be used to log all system events (e.g. temperature changes, button
presses, etc.)
